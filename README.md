# üé° Overview

InEdu is a web-based platform for enhancing employee skills and knowledge. InEdu aims to improve the abilities of employees who need training where there are videos and learning readings so that employees can learn at their own pace. Each course has interactive slides featuring videos, readings & quizzes.


## üéØ High-Level Architecture
The following figure demonstrates the tech stacks used on this project on a high-level architecture diagram.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology and Frameworks

- [GO](https://go.dev/doc/) as Programming Language
- [echo](https://labstack.com/echo) as high performance framework
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/docs/) for the initial migration and creation of the database schema
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/)
- Implement custom Error Handling
- Using JWT as a Token via [jwt-go package](https://github.com/dgrijalva/jwt-go)
- Implement Role based authorization
- Write unit test for API endpoint and middlewares
- Using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) for packaging applications into containers
- Using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) for Deployment

### üßπ Clean Architecture

As previously mentioned, the project implements Clean Architecture. The four layers of the project are:

- Domain Layer
- Repository Layer
- Usecase Layer
- Controller Layer

#### The Diagram

![golang clean architecture](https://github.com/daffaalex22/jobdir/raw/main/CleanArch.png)

From the picture above, the four rounded rectangular correspond to each Clean Architecture layer. The slightly bolder arrow pointing from a certain layer to another pictures the dependency of the layer. For example, the domain layer (red) is pointing to repository layer (purple). This means that the repository layer imports package from domain and thus the repository layer depends on the domain layer.
